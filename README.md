Pico Admin Plugin
=================

This is the repository of Pico's official admin plugin.

Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS. See http://picocms.org/ for more info.

**WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT YET USABLE**  
This is a development preview. It isn't ready for testing by non-developers, far less from ready for production use!

Install
-------

Just [download the latest release](https://github.com/PhrozenByte/pico-admin/releases/latest) and upload the `PicoAdmin` directory to the `plugins` directory of your Pico installation (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico/plugins/`). You can now navigate to the admin panel (e.g. `http://example.com/pico/?admin`), where you will find the necessary information about how to configure and run the plugin. The plugin requires Pico 1.1+
