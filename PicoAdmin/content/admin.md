## Pico Admin Panel

If you see this, something went terribly wrong. This is dummy content for Pico installations below (let me look into my crystal ball...) Pico 2.0, which don't support skipping the actual page processing of Pico. You should [report this incident to the developers of Pico Admin](https://github.com/PhrozenByte/pico-admin/issues), so they can fix this. Please don't forget to describe how exactly you got to this point. This might be an issue with an third-party admin module, so please also add a list of admin modules you've installed.
